#  WorkoutBuddy iOS Application :weight_lifting_man:

## Inspiration
Ever had to switch between your workout planner and timer apps every set during your workout?

WorkoutBuddy combines a workout planner and a rest timer so that users will only need to remain in one app during their workout. It displays the information about the exercise and the number of sets and reps during the exercise, and switches to the rest timer during your rest period, without the need for switching apps!

## Functions
WorkoutBuddy allows you to:
* Create a database of exercises
* Craft and edit your own workouts using your exercises
* Input your desired number of sets, reps, and rest period for each exercise in the workout

WorkoutBuddy will then guide you through your own workout, through every set and rest period!
